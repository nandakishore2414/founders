# Founder Platform - Project Summary

## Overview
Founder Platform is a social networking web application designed specifically for startup founders. It facilitates connecting, sharing updates, discovering other founders, and learning through short-form content.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 (via Vite)
- **Language**: JavaScript (JSX)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (using `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Key Features & Structure

### 1. Navigation & Layout
- **Global Header**: Accessible on main views (Home, Network, Profile).
- **Dedicated Shorts Layout**: The "Shorts" view uses a custom, immersive layout with a transparent icon-only sidebar (`ShortsSidebar.jsx`) instead of the main header, maximizing content space.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hidden/shown elements based on viewport size.

### 2. Core Modules
- **Feed (`Feed.jsx`)**: The central hub for posts and updates from the network.
- **Shorts (`Shorts.jsx`)**: A TikTok/Reels-style vertical video player.
  - **Features**: 
    - Full-height immersive video experience.
    - Floating action buttons (Like, Comment, Share) positioned outside the video on desktop.
    - Custom scroll navigation buttons (Up/Down).
    - Auto-playing videos with play/pause toggle.
    - Marquee animation for audio tracks.
- **Founder Discovery (`FounderDiscovery.jsx`)**: A network page to find and connect with other founders.
- **Founder Identity (`FounderIdentity.jsx`)**: User profile management and display.
- **Build Updates (`CreateBuildUpdate.jsx`)**: specific post type for sharing startup progress.
- **Mastermind Groups (`MastermindGroups.jsx`)**: Community-focused group feature.
- **Messages (`Messages.jsx`)**: Direct messaging interface.

### 3. Recent Updates
- **Shorts Redesign**: 
  - Transformed from a basic list to a high-fidelity, immersive experience.
  - Implemented snap scrolling and keyboard/button navigation.
  - Refined UI with transparent sidebars and floating actions for a modern feel.
  - Optimized for desktop viewing by centering content in a mobile-aspect container ('max-w-2xl').

## Component Architecture
- **App.jsx**: Main entry point handling routing (state-based view switching) and layout logic (Header vs Sidebar).
- **UI Components**: Modular components for cards (`ReelCard`, `FounderCard`, `PostCard`) and layout elements (`LeftSidebar`, `RightSidebar`).

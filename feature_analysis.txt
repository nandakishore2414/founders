================================================================================
  FOUNDER PLATFORM — FEATURE ANALYSIS & GAP REPORT
  Generated: 2026-02-19
================================================================================


================================================================================
 1. APP ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

Files: App.jsx, FounderLayout.jsx, InvestorLayout.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Role-based SPA with two layouts: Founder Mode and Investor Mode.
  - State: currentView (navigation), activeMode (founder/investor), user object.
  - User has an array of roles: ["founder", "investor"] or subsets.

FLOW:
  1. App loads → checks user.roles → defaults to "founder" mode (unless investor-only).
  2. FounderLayout renders for founder mode, InvestorLayout for investor mode.
  3. currentView drives which component renders in the content area.
  4. Header, sidebars, and views change based on activeMode.

AVAILABLE VIEWS (FOUNDER MODE):
  - home          → Feed
  - shorts        → Shorts (full-screen, no header)
  - founder       → FounderIdentity (startup profile)
  - create-update → CreateBuildUpdate
  - create-post   → CreatePost
  - network       → FounderDiscovery
  - messages      → Messages
  - profile       → ProfilePage (full-width, no sidebars)

AVAILABLE VIEWS (INVESTOR MODE):
  - investor-dashboard → InvestorDashboard
  - discover           → FounderDiscovery
  - saved              → "Coming Soon" placeholder
  - messages           → Messages
  - founder            → FounderIdentity (viewing a founder profile)
  - home/shorts        → Redirect message to dashboard

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ handleRoleChange in App.jsx only logs to console — does nothing.
  ✗ No route/URL support — everything is state-driven, no back button support.
  ✗ InvestorLayout shows LeftSidebar with hardcoded "Investor Tools", not the
    shared LeftSidebar component (inconsistency).
  ✗ "saved" view in InvestorLayout shows AccessRestricted with "coming soon"
    but is still listed as a nav option — misleading.


================================================================================
 2. HEADER & NAVIGATION
================================================================================

File: Header.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Fixed top navigation bar with logo, nav items, search, actions, profile menu.
  - Different nav items based on layout (founder vs investor).
  - Profile dropdown with: My Profile, Settings, Logout, Mode Switch, Role Debug.

FLOW:
  1. User sees nav: Home, Network, Shorts, Founder Profile (founder layout).
  2. Clicking nav items calls onNavigate(viewName).
  3. Profile avatar → dropdown with My Profile, Settings, Logout.
  4. Mode switch button lets dual-role users toggle founder/investor.
  5. Role debug selector (DEV ONLY) changes user.roles for testing.

FOUNDER NAV ITEMS: Home, Network, Shorts, Founder Profile
INVESTOR NAV ITEMS: Dashboard, Discover, Messages

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ Search bar is visual-only — no search logic implemented.
  ✗ Notification bell icon has a red dot but no notification system.
  ✗ Message icon navigates to messages but has no unread count logic.
  ✗ "Settings" in the dropdown does nothing (no settings page exists).
  ✗ "Logout" button does nothing (no auth system).
  ✗ Mobile hamburger menu toggles open but nav items still show as full nav.
  ✗ Role debug selector is in production UI — should be dev-only/hidden.


================================================================================
 3. FEED (HOME PAGE)
================================================================================

File: Feed.jsx, PostCard.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Main content feed showing posts from founders.
  - Post types: Video, Thread, Case Study, Hiring, Poll, General.
  - Story-style "Updates" row at top (avatar circles).
  - "Explore Topics" pill buttons for content filtering.
  - Create Post button triggers navigation to create-post view.
  - Build Update button triggers navigation to create-update view.

FLOW:
  1. User sees story updates row → explore topics pills → post cards.
  2. Post cards show: author info, content, images, engagement actions.
  3. Clicking "Like" toggles like state (local state only).
  4. Comment/Share/Save interactions are click handlers with no backend.
  5. "Create a Post" button → navigates to 'create-post' view.

POST CARD FEATURES:
  - Author name, avatar, description, timestamp
  - Post type badge (Video, Thread, Case Study, Hiring, Poll)
  - Content text with "Read more" truncation
  - Image display
  - Actions: Like (toggleable), Comment, Share, Save

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ All posts are hardcoded mock data — no dynamic loading.
  ✗ Like state is local — resets on navigation.
  ✗ "Read more" does not expand — text just stays truncated.
  ✗ Comment button does nothing — no comment section/modal.
  ✗ Share button does nothing (no share logic or modal).
  ✗ Save button has no visual feedback or saved items page.
  ✗ Story "Updates" row is static — clicking stories does nothing.
  ✗ "Explore Topics" pills have no filtering logic — UI only.
  ✗ No infinite scroll or pagination — all posts render at once.
  ✗ No "create post" CTA visible within the feed itself (only on sidebar).


================================================================================
 4. CREATE POST
================================================================================

File: CreatePost.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Multi-format post creation form.
  - 6 post types: Video Insight, Thread, Case Study, Hiring, Poll, General.
  - Each type has a different sub-form with relevant fields.

FLOW:
  1. User navigates to create-post from header or sidebar.
  2. Sees type selector cards (6 types).
  3. Selects a type → sub-form appears with type-specific fields.
  4. Fills fields → clicks "Publish" or "Save Draft" / "Cancel".
  5. Cancel navigates back to home.

SUB-FORMS:
  - VideoForm: Title, Video URL, Description, Thumbnail Upload
  - ThreadForm: Title, multiple thread sections (add/remove), image upload
  - CaseStudyForm: Title, Problem, Solution, Results, Takeaways
  - HiringForm: Role Title, Company, Location, Type, Description, Apply Link
  - PollForm: Question, Options (add/remove), Duration
  - GenericForm: Title, Content

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ No form validation at all — can submit empty forms.
  ✗ No character count tracking despite showing "0/X" labels.
  ✗ "Publish" button does nothing — no submit handler.
  ✗ "Save Draft" does nothing — no draft storage.
  ✗ File/image upload is visual-only — no actual file handling.
  ✗ No preview of the post before publishing.
  ✗ Thread sections can be added with "+", remove logic exists, but no 
    reordering/drag support.
  ✗ Poll options have no validation (e.g., minimum 2 options).
  ✗ No access restriction — any role can create posts (intentional?).


================================================================================
 5. CREATE BUILD UPDATE
================================================================================

File: CreateBuildUpdate.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Founder-exclusive structured update form (Founder Access Only).
  - 7 update types: Feature Shipped, Milestone, Pivot, Failure, Revenue,
    Insight, Hiring.
  - Fields: Headline, What We Did, Outcome, Lesson, Attachments.

FLOW:
  1. Only accessible if user hasRole('founder') — otherwise shows AccessRestricted.
  2. User selects update type from a visual grid.
  3. Fills structured fields: Headline (required), What We Did (required),
     Outcome (optional), Lesson (optional).
  4. Can add image/video attachment via drag-and-drop zone.
  5. Actions: "Save Draft" or "Publish Update".

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ No form validation — required fields are not enforced.
  ✗ Character counters show "0/60" and "0/300" but don't actually count.
  ✗ "Publish Update" button has no onClick handler — does nothing.
  ✗ "Save Draft" calls onCancel (goes back to home) — misleading label.
  ✗ File upload is visual-only — no actual upload logic.
  ✗ No preview before publishing.
  ✗ Headline has a 60 char limit UI hint but no maxLength enforcement.


================================================================================
 6. SHORTS (REELS/TIKTOK-STYLE)
================================================================================

File: Shorts.jsx, ShortsSidebar.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Full-screen vertical video feed (TikTok/Reels style).
  - Replaces header with a minimal icon sidebar (ShortsSidebar).
  - Vertical snap-scrolling between short-form content.
  - Action buttons: Like, Comment, Share, Bookmark, More.

FLOW:
  1. User clicks "Shorts" in nav → header disappears, ShortsSidebar appears.
  2. Full-screen vertical content with snap scrolling.
  3. Like (heart toggle), Bookmark (toggle), Comment/Share/More (no-op).
  4. Play/Pause toggling on click (visual only — no actual video).
  5. Mute/unmute button (visual only).
  6. Navigation: up/down buttons on the right side.

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ Using static images, NOT actual videos — play/pause is fake.
  ✗ No actual video playback, muting, or audio.
  ✗ Likes are local state only.
  ✗ Comment button does nothing.
  ✗ Share button does nothing.
  ✗ "Follow" button does nothing.
  ✗ Only 3 hardcoded reels — no loading more.
  ✗ Music/audio label shows but no audio plays.
  ✗ ShortsSidebar "Profile" nav goes to 'founder' (FounderIdentity),
    not 'profile' (ProfilePage) — inconsistency.


================================================================================
 7. FOUNDER IDENTITY (STARTUP PROFILE PAGE)
================================================================================

File: FounderIdentity.jsx

WHAT IT IS:
  - Public-facing startup profile page (different from ProfilePage).
  - Hero section: Startup name, tagline, founder info, key stats, vision quote.
  - Reputation Signals: Score, Response Rate, Collaborations.
  - Two tabs: Overview (build updates list) and Build Timeline.

FLOW:
  1. Accessible via nav → "Founder Profile" or from viewing a founder.
  2. Shows startup details, reputation metrics (investor-visible analytics).
  3. Overview tab: Displays build update cards using BuildUpdateCard component.
  4. Build Timeline tab: Chronological updates (founder-only visibility).

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ All data is hardcoded — not connected to user state.
  ✗ No "Edit" functionality for founders viewing their own identity page.
  ✗ Build Timeline tab only shows if user is a founder — but doesn't check
    if it's the SAME founder (no ownership concept).
  ✗ Reputation signals visible only if canViewAnalytics (investor/dual role),
    but all data is static.
  ✗ No connection between this page and ProfilePage — user has TWO separate
    profile pages with different data and layout.
  ✗ "Respond" / "Save" buttons on updates do nothing.


================================================================================
 8. PROFILE PAGE (INSTAGRAM-STYLE)
================================================================================

FLOW:
  1. Accessible via Header dropdown → "My Profile".
  2. Full-width layout (sidebars hidden).
  3. Shows founder's personal info + startup details.
  4. Pitch highlights as Instagram-story circles.
  5. Tabs switch between Overview, Build Timeline, Posts grid, Team list.

GAPS / ISSUES:
  ✗ ALL DATA IS HARDCODED — nothing comes from props or state.
    The `user` prop is accepted but almost unused.
  ✗ "Edit Profile" button does nothing — no edit form exists.
  ✗ "Edit Cover" button does nothing.
  ✗ "Share" button does nothing.

  ✗ Team members are hardcoded — no team management.
  ✗ Hiring CTA links do nothing.
  ✗ Revenue trajectory chart is a static SVG — not real data.
  ✗ isOwnProfile is hardcoded to true — no logic to detect other profiles.

  ✗ No way to edit bio, update startup info, change avatar, etc.


================================================================================

  ✗ Quick filter pills toggle active state but don't filter results.
  ✗ Advanced filters (checkboxes, selects, range) are visual-only.

  ✗ Suggested tab hardcodes "SaaS" as the user's industry.
  ✗ No pagination or infinite scroll for founder lists.

================================================================================
================================================================================
  CRITICAL GAPS SUMMARY — PRIORITIZED
================================================================================
================================================================================

CATEGORY 1: BROKEN / MISLEADING UI (Things that look functional but aren't)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Profile "Edit Profile" button → no edit form
  2. "Settings" in dropdown → no settings page
  3. "Logout" button → no logout logic
  4. Search bar everywhere → no search logic
  5. All filter UIs → no filtering logic
  6. "Publish" on CreatePost & CreateBuildUpdate → no submit handler
  7. "Save Draft" on CreateBuildUpdate → actually navigates home
  8. Notification bell → no notification system
  9. Phone/Video call buttons in Messages → no-op
  10. "Export Report" on Investor Dashboard → no-op

CATEGORY 2: DATA & STATE (No persistence, all mock)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. ALL data is hardcoded mock — zero API/backend integration.
  2. Like/save/follow states reset on navigation.
  3. Messages sent are lost on navigation.
  4. No user authentication or sessions.
  5. No form data persistence (drafts, submissions).
  6. handleRoleChange only logs — doesn't update roles.

CATEGORY 3: MISSING FEATURES (Expected but not built)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. NO profile editing (bio, avatar, cover, startup info).
  2. NO settings page (account, privacy, notifications).
  3. NO comment system on posts.
  4. NO follow/follower system.
  5. NO notifications system.
  6. NO saved items page (bookmarks).
  7. NO actual video playback in Shorts.
  8. NO new conversation creation in Messages.
  9. NO file upload handling anywhere.
  10. NO URL routing / deep linking / back button support.

CATEGORY 4: LOGIC ERRORS & INCONSISTENCIES
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. TWO profile pages exist (ProfilePage + FounderIdentity) serving
     overlapping purposes with different data and no connection.
  2. ShortsSidebar "Profile" → goes to 'founder' (FounderIdentity),
     Header "My Profile" → goes to 'profile' (ProfilePage). Inconsistent.
  3. ProfilePage.isOwnProfile is hardcoded to true — can never view
     another user's profile.
  4. ProfilePage accepts user prop but uses hardcoded FOUNDER object.
  5. RightSidebar profile card data is not connected to actual user state.
  6. CreateBuildUpdate "Save Draft" label → actually calls onCancel.
  7. InvestorDashboard shows "High compatability" — typo.
  8. FounderCard defines its own Flame SVG instead of importing from
     lucide-react — potential rendering inconsistency.
  9. Copyright says "2024" in LeftSidebar.
  10. Left sidebar only shows on home view but is rendered for all
      non-shorts, non-profile views (including network, messages, etc.)
      where trending/leaderboard make less contextual sense.
